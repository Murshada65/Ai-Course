Course Title: Artificial Intelligence

i. Purpose of This Course
The purpose of the Artificial Intelligence course is to introduce students to the foundational concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of AI. It emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation of intelligent systems, enabling learners to build problem-solving models that mimic human reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

ii. What I Learned From This Course
Core AI concepts including search algorithms, knowledge representation, and decision-making strategies.

Implemented classical algorithms such as:

Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning (for game playing)

A*, Beam Search, Best-First Search, BFS, DFS, DLS, IDS, Bidirectional Search (for pathfinding and problem solving)

Developed GUI-based AI applications using Python libraries like Pygame and Tkinter.

Explored AI-powered creative tools for video and slide generation (e.g., InVideo, Gamma, Runway Gen-3).

Gained experience in debugging, optimizing workflows, and managing projects using Git and GitHub.

iii. Duration of This Course
TOTAL 6 MONTHES.
