Gameplay for the Ai chess application found in chess.py



*How to run the file:*



1.Save the code: Ensure the provided PYTHON cod is saved as chess.py within the appropriate dictionary(i.e.AI-Games).



2\. Open the terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the dictionary containing chess.py .



3\. Execute: Run the script using your PYTHON interpreter.





*Required Software/Library/Framework:*



the game requires python 3.x  and 2 essential third-party libraries. You must install all them using pip before running the file:



1.Pygame: Used for the graphic interface (window, board, piece drawing and mouse input).



2.Python-chess: A powerful library used for all chess rules, move validation, board state management and standard chess logic.





*How to play the game:*



1\. Launch the Game



- Run the Python script in an environment where pygame and python-chess are installed.



-A window titled "Chess - Player vs Computer (Minimax AI)" will open with an 8Ã—8 chessboard.



2\. Player Turn (White)



-You play as White.



-Use your mouse to interact:



>Click on a white piece to select it.



>Legal moves for that piece will be shown as green dots.



>Click on a destination square to move the piece.



>If the move is legal, it will be executed.



>If you move a pawn to the last rank (promotion), it will auto-promote to a Queen (or another piece if legal).



3\. Computer Turn (Black)



-After your move, the AI (Black) will automatically calculate and play its move using Minimax with depth 2.



-There's a short delay (pygame.time.wait(300)) before the AI moves.



4\. Game End Conditions



The game ends when:



1.Checkmate: One side wins.



2.Stalemate: No legal moves, but not in check.



3.Insufficient Material: Not enough pieces to checkmate.



4.75-move Rule or Fivefold Repetition: Draw conditions.



When the game ends:



-A message like "Player Wins!", "Computer Wins!", or "Draw" will be displayed for 4 seconds.



5\. Exit the Game



-Close the window or click the red X to quit.



-The game will shut down cleanly with pygame.quit() and sys.exit().
