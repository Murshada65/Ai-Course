\# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax)



This is a GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Tkinter. You play as \*\*X\*\*, and the AI plays as \*\*O\*\*, using the \*\*Minimax algorithm\*\* to make optimal moves.



\## How to Run the Game



1\. Make sure you have \*\*Python 3.x\*\* installed.

2\. Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If not, install it:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  pip install tk

3.Run the game:

python tic\_tac\_toe.py



*## How to Play:*



-You play as X.



-Click on any empty cell to make your move.



-The AI will respond automatically.



-The game ends when either player wins or the board is full (draw).



*##Algorithm Used:*



-Minimax Algorithm: A recursive decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to simulate all possible moves and choose the optimal one.



*## Dependencies:*



-Python 3.x



-Tkinter (standard GUI library in Python)
