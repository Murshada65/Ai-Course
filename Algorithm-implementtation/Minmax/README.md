**Minimax Algorithm**



*How the Algorithm Works:*



Minimax is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in two-player, turn-based games. It assumes both players play optimally and aims to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. The algorithm evaluates the game tree by simulating all possible moves and counter-moves, assigning scores to terminal states, and propagating those scores back up the tree.



*Key Concepts:*



-Maximizing player: Tries to get the highest score.



-Minimizing player: Tries to reduce the maximizing player’s score.



-The algorithm alternates between these roles at each level of the tree.



-At each node, it chooses the move that leads to the best guaranteed outcome.





Minimax is often enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning to reduce the number of nodes evaluated.

*Time and Space Complexity:*



Scenario	Complexity



Time	        O(b^d) — where b is branching factor, d is depth of the game tree.

Space	        O(d) — for recursive stack in depth-first traversal.



Best Case	Efficient with pruning or shallow depth.



Worst Case	Exponential growth in deep trees without pruning.





Minimax is complete and optimal for zero-sum games with perfect information, but can be computationally expensive for complex games.
