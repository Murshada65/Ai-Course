**Best-First Search Algorithm**





*How the Algorithm Works:*



Best-First Search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide its traversal through a graph or search space. It selects the most promising node based on the lowest heuristic cost and expands it first. The algorithm maintains a priority queue where nodes are sorted by their heuristic value.



*Key Steps:*

Start from the initial node.



Evaluate all neighboring nodes using a heuristic function ‚Ñé(ùëõ)



Select the node with the lowest heuristic value.



Repeat the process until the goal node is reached.



Unlike A\*, Best-First Search does not consider the cost from the start node ‚Äî it only uses the estimated cost to the goal, which can lead to faster but non-optimal paths.



*Applications of Best-First Search:*



1.Pathfinding in AI and games:



-Maze solving



-NPC movement



2.Robotics:



-Navigation and obstacle avoidance



3.Web crawling:



-Prioritizing pages based on relevance



4.Decision-making systems:



-Planning and scheduling



5.Puzzle solving:



-Finding approximate solutions quickly





*Time and Space Complexity:*



Scenario	Complexity



Time	        O(b^d) ‚Äî where b is branching factor, d is depth.



Space	        O(b^d) ‚Äî stores all generated nodes.



Best Case	Fast with a good heuristic.



Worst Case	May explore many irrelevant paths if heuristic is poor.





Best-First Search is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, but it is efficient for large spaces when speed is prioritized over optimality.
